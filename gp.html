.i am from Delhi but i am living in gurugram I have moved to this city three months ago. I love the street food here. On weekends, I explore new eating joints. This way, I get to learn the routes of this city and prepare myself professionally.
I like watching movies, at least once a month. I play basketball on weekends and chess whenever I get time. I’m into reading thriller novels as well, Dan Brown being my favorite novelist.
I’m happy to step into college life, which provides more freedom and where, finally, I don’t have to come in a uniform </p>
